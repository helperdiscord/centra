Welcome! This will be my first blog post as a developer of Petitio and for
the new documentation site - exciting times!

As a collaborative project, Petitio has become the fastest high-level HTTP
library in the Node ecosystem, and one of the first to use undici instead of
native HTTP.

Our current plans are to implement hooks and then add HTTP/2 support to undici.

Thank you, and that's all for now. Stay tuned for more.
